## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

Scroll down to learn more about how SketchyOrNot works, what happens to your image, and how we keep your experience private and judgment-free.

### 🖼️ What is SketchyOrNot?

[SketchyOrNot.com](http://SketchyOrNot.com) helps you quickly check if a screenshot of a message, email, or DM might have sketchy signs — before you click, reply, or send money. You just upload or drag in a screenshot, and the AI returns useful insights so **you can make a more informed decision**.

---

### 🤳 What can I upload?

You can upload a **screenshot or photo** of:

- A suspicious **text message**
- A weird **DM or promo offer**
- A strange **email from “your bank”**
- A **QR code flyer or letter** that showed up at your door
- Any message that just gives you a weird feeling

If you can screenshot it, you can upload it.

---

### 🔍 What happens after I upload?

Once you upload or drag in your screenshot:

1. The image is quickly scanned by AI.
2. The AI looks for **signs that something might be sketchy**, like:
   - Urgent or threatening wording
   - Misspelled brand names
   - Weird phone numbers or email addresses
   - Suspicious links or requests
3. You’ll get results **right here on the page**, usually in seconds.

---

### 🧠 Do I have to type anything in?

Nope.

There’s **no typing required** and no search box.

The AI is already told what to do — it looks at your screenshot and returns insights automatically.

---

### 🛑**Does SketchyOrNot say if something is safe or dangerous?** 

**No. We don’t label things as “safe.”**

**We show you what might look suspicious — patterns, red flags, and warning signs.**

**You decide what to do with that info.**

**📀 Is my image stored or saved?**

No.

Your uploaded screenshot is **only used once** to generate results — and then it’s gone.

We do **not store, track, or keep your image**, and we don’t collect personal info.

---

### 🔒 What about my privacy?

- **We don’t ask for names, emails, or logins.**
- We **don’t store the screenshots**.
- We **don’t track your device or identity**.
- We believe in checking things **without judgment or risk** — just curiosity, caution, and learning.

---

### ⏱ How long does it take?

Usually **a few seconds**, depending on the image size and traffic.

You’ll see your results appear right on the page when they’re ready.

---

### 💡 Can I save the results?

Yes\!

Once the results appear, you can:

- **Take a screenshot** for later
- **Copy the text** to send to a friend or family member

We don’t store results for you — this keeps your use private and anonymous.

---

### 🌱 Will this teach me what to look for next time?

Yes — that’s part of the mission and why we want everyone to use [SketchyOrNot.com](http://SketchyOrNot.com) 

Every time you upload, you’ll see examples of what _might_ look sketchy. Over time, you’ll start spotting red flags **before** you even upload.

Think of it like a digital gut-check that also helps train your scam radar.

---

### 💸 Does it cost anything?

Nope — it’s free to use.

If you want to support the project and help more people stay scam-aware, you can **leave a tip**. That’s it. No upsells, no memberships. We believe being safer should have no cost barrier. 

---

### 🤖 What tech is behind this?

We use AI to analyze screenshots for sketchy language, patterns, and behavior — including **GPT-4 with vision**. The smart part runs in the background, but the experience stays simple, fast, and human-friendly for you.

---

### 🧯 What if I upload something with personal information?

We encourage you to **black out anything super personal** before uploading (like a Social Security number, full address, or bank account digits), just to be extra safe.

That said, your image is **never saved** or reused — it’s only scanned once, and then deleted.

---

### 📞 Can I ask someone to help me understand the results?

Yes — please feel free to **share your screenshot \+ results** with a friend, coworker, or family member to talk it through. We always recommend checking with someone you trust if you’re unsure.

---

### 🧭 Can this be used by schools or community programs?

Yes, absolutely.

SketchyOrNot was built for everyday people — teens, seniors, parents, workers, neighbors — and we’d love to support communities who want to teach scam awareness.
